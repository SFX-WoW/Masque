## Localization

Due to the scope of _World of Warcraft_ and its gaming community, one of the easiest and most important ways you can contribute to an add-on is through translations. The recommended way to help localize _Masque_ is by using the [localization system] on WoW Ace. This system provides a web interface and helps simplify updating translations.

## Bug Reports

When reporting issues with _Masque_, please use the [issue tracker] on GitHub. This helps keep them in one location, making it easier to keep track of them. Always make sure there isn't an existing issue on the problem you're having.

### Submitting a Bug Report

Explain the problem and include as much information as possible. When creating the report, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Use a short but descriptive title.
- Specify the version of _Masque_ you have installed.
- List any supporting add-ons and skins that you have installed.
- Describe, in detail, the steps necessary to reproduce the problem.
- Include any additional information or screenshots that may be relevant to addressing the issue.
- When posting error messages, enclose them in `code` tags.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are only accepted for localization updates. All other submissions must be made via the [issue tracker]. When submitting translations via a pull request, please keep in mind the following:

- Commits must be simple and concise, preceded by a dash and a space. Eg:
  - `- Update enUS.`
- When updating a localization file, only edit what needs to be edited. All edits will be checked locally and validated with LuaCheck.
- Consider updating the [localization system] on WoW Ace since that's where all translations are pulled from.
