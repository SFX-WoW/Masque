## Localization

Due to the scope of _World of Warcraft_ and its gaming community, one of the most important ways one can contribute to an add-on is through translations. The recommended way of contributing in this way is by using the [localization system] on WoW Ace, which provides a web interface to simplify the process.

## Bug Reports

When reporting issues with this add-on, please use the [issue tracker] on GitHub. This helps keep them in one location, making it easier to keep track of them. Always make sure there isn't an existing issue on the problem you're having.

### Submitting a Bug Report

Explain the problem and include as much information as possible. When creating the report, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Use a short but descriptive title.
- Specify the version of the add-on and any dependencies you have installed.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are only accepted for localization updates. All other submissions must be made via the [issue tracker]. When submitting translations via a pull request, please keep in mind the following:

- Commits must be simple and concise, preceded by a dash and a space. Eg:
  - `- Update enUS.`
- When updating a localization file, only edit what needs to be edited. All edits will be checked locally and validated with LuaCheck.
- Consider updating the [localization system] on WoW Ace since that's where all translations are pulled from.
