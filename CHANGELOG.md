## 11.0.0

### Reminder

In case you missed it, you can now select the style of spell alerts that **Masque** uses and which animations are shown. These options are found under **Masque** > **General Settings** > **Advanced**.

- Spell Alert Animations
  - **None** - Disables spell alerts completely
  - **Flash and Loop** - Enables both the flash and looping animations. Note that some styles may not have flash animations.
  - **Loop Only** - Disables the flash animation.
- Spell Alert style
  - **None** - Forces **Masque** to use the game's default animations, regardless of skin shape.
  - **Classic** - A style that's similar to the **Classic** spell alert animation.
  - **Modern** - A style that's similar to **Dragonflight**'s spell alert animation.
  - **Thin** - A minimalistic animation that works well on darker, pixel skins.

**Note:** These animations are currently only available on the **Retail** client.
