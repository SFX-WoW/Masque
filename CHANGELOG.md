## 10.1.1

### Settings

- Replaced the **Minimap Icon** setting with an **Icon Menu** setting, a drop-down that allows a choice between no icon (default), a minimap icon or the new add-on compartment menu.
  - **Important:** The add-on compartment setting may cause taint, so use it at your own risk.
- Switched to using `LibDBIcon-1.0` for add-on compartment registration, thanks to [Funkeh](https://github.com/funkydude).

### Skins

- Skin authors can now add a `string` **Discord** URL via the `Discord` skin field that will be displayed in the skin information panel.

### Localization

- Added some new phrases that will need to be translated.

### Supporters

- Added [Mayron](https://github.com/mayron) as a supporter. Thanks!
